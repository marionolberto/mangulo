# SMDC4
The Spectrum Management System for Developing Countries (SMS4DC) provides various functionalities for spectrum management activities. Version 5.2 of the software was developed from the contribution of MSIP (Republic of Korea). It contains the revised Article 5 of the Radio Regulations (as per decisions made at WRC-19), as well as further development on data transfer from other databases to the SMS4DC, such as BR Space IFIC Version 9, and calculations according to the HCM (European cross-border frequency coordination agreement).
The SMS4DC also contains monitoring network planning for optimization of spectrum monitoring networks, an interface to the spectrum monitoring software of Rohde & Schwarz and of Thales and a general interface for any other monitoring software (TCI's for example).
Self-learning training material can be provided upon request.
